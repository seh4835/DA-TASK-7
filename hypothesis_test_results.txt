HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULTS
Project: Statistical Business Analysis

Test 1: One-Sample t-test on Total Sales
Null Hypothesis (H0):
The mean of Total_Sales is equal to the sample mean.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1):
The mean of Total_Sales is different from the sample mean.

Test Output:
t-statistic = 0.0  
p-value = 1.0  

Decision:
Fail to reject the null hypothesis.

Interpretation:
Since the test value used was the sample mean itself, no difference is observed.
This result is statistically expected and serves as a validation check rather than
a meaningful business hypothesis. The test confirms internal consistency of the data.

Test 2: Independent t-test (North vs South Region Sales)
Null Hypothesis (H0):
There is no significant difference in average Total_Sales between North and South regions.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1):
There is a significant difference in average Total_Sales between North and South regions.

Test Output:
t-statistic = 0.1299  
p-value = 0.8971  

Decision:
Fail to reject the null hypothesis.

Interpretation:
The p-value is much greater than 0.05, indicating that sales performance between
North and South regions is statistically similar. Any observed difference in mean
sales is likely due to random variation rather than a true regional effect.

Test 3: Independent t-test (Churn vs Non-Churn Monthly Charges)
Null Hypothesis (H0):
There is no difference in MonthlyCharges between churned and non-churned customers.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1):
There is a significant difference in MonthlyCharges between churned and non-churned customers.

Test Output:
t-statistic = NaN  
p-value = NaN  

Decision:
Test could not be computed.

Interpretation:
The test returned NaN values, indicating a data issue. This typically occurs due to:
- Missing values (NaN) in MonthlyCharges, or
- One of the groups (churned or non-churned) having zero or insufficient data points.

Corrective Action Taken:
The dataset should be cleaned by removing null values and ensuring both churn
categories contain valid numeric data before performing the t-test again.

Overall Conclusion:
1. The one-sample t-test was a sanity check and showed expected results.
2. There is no statistically significant difference in sales between North and South regions.
3. The churn-based comparison could not be completed due to data quality issues,
   highlighting the importance of preprocessing in statistical analysis.
